        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the USNStart Coworking Space Privacy Policy. Your privacy is of paramount importance to us, and we are committed to protecting the personal 
            information you share with us. <br> This policy outlines our practices regarding data collection, use, and disclosure of personal information we receive from 
            users of our site.</p>
        
        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>We collect information to provide better services to all of our users - from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things
            <br> like which services you'll find most useful.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. 
                <br>Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, and phone number.</li>
            <li><strong>Log Data:</strong> Like many site operators, we collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our site ("Log Data"). 
                <br>This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser version, 
                <br>the pages of our site that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, and other statistics.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>We use "cookies" to collect information. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage,
            <br> is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
